                    </div><p>Kountze Park was developed in the Kountze Place neighborhood by Herman Kountze in the 1880s in the newly-developed territory of Omaha, NE. In the mid-1890s though, a recession hit Omaha hard. Despite their Gilded Age dreams, the wealthy weren’t getting richer and their schemes weren’t taking off. This included Kountze’s jewel in North Omaha. A group of Omaha businessmen saw the successes of the 1893 Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition though, and by 1896 they envisioned a late Victorian wonderland in their fair </p>

                <p>In late 1897, Kountze must’ve felt pretty proud of himself. The City of Omaha was working with a committee to determine the ideal location for the 1898 Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, and had narrowed their choices down to five places scattered around the city. In the last moment though, Kountze came through with a non-solicited late entry, and won the bid.</p>

        <p>The Kountze Place neighborhood grew into an urban suburban dreamland. Its lovely lagoon was the site of much fishing, while its pavilion housed recreation specialists from the City of Omaha from the 1920s through the 1960s. The lagoon began to sink and was drained, filled with dirt and seeded in the 1960s.</p>
